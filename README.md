# Data Projects - TripleTen Bootcamp Repository

This repository contains multiple data science projects developed during the TripleTen Bootcamp. Each folder houses a self‑contained project with its own code, data (or data instructions), and documentation.

Projects Overview

## 1. Customer Churn Analysis

Location: Customer-Churn-Analysis/Description: Predict which telecom customers are likely to churn using demographic, usage, and contract data. Implements data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), and evaluation (ROC-AUC, confusion matrix).

## 2. Time Series Forecasting

Location: Time-Series-Project/Description: Build and evaluate time series forecasting models (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) on real-world datasets (e.g., sales, energy consumption). Includes decomposition, stationarity tests, hyperparameter tuning, and backtesting.

## 3. Age Prediction CNN

Location: age-prediction-project/Description: Predict a person’s age from face images using Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet50 or MobileNetV2 backbone). Covers data loading, augmentation, model definition, training (with early stopping & checkpointing), and error analysis (MAE ≈ 8–9 years).
